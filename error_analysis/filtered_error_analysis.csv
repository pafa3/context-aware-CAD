"Speaker1: [Pro LGBT Jesuit priest James Martin](https://i.redd.it/ingvealc8rm21.jpg) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since 2011 the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives has been LGBT advocate Jesuit priest Patrick Conroy. Republicans, who held a majority of seats in 2011, and Democrats, who now hold the majority of seats, voted him in. Pro LGBT Jesuit priest James Martin has received awards from groups propagating the gay agenda. Jesuit priests promote the normalization of the LGBT by referring to parts of the bible that deals with accepting all people. But to claim that God made a mistake in creating you, and 'you' know better is adversarial and contrary to the Scriptures. A Catholic priest in Denver expressed this notion after Regis University, a Jesuit-Catholic university, encouraged it's faculty to attend a student-ran drag show commemorating ""Transgender Day of Remembrance"". The Jesuits have a hand in promoting LGBT which will help lead into transhumanism.

"Speaker1: Please note that I'm not some troll, I do genuinely believe many conspiracies on this subreddit, but this is one I can't get behind. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A common argument is that the rates for allergies, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. are rising, just as vaccination rates. Many people draw the conclusion that there is causation between the two. Come on lads, we learned this early on. **Correlation does NOT equal causation.**  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Allergy rates and cancer rates and autoimmune disorder rates all that jazz are rising. Well no shit, Sherlock. The population is increasing rapidly, and the people genetically predisposed to these conditions reproduce and create more who are genetically predisposed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Take 4 people. 2 men, 2 women. 3 have to predisposition to Alzheimer's, 1 does. Each man has children with one of the women. The man who has a predisposition to Alzheimer's passes it on to 2 kids, say both men. The couple without it doesn't pass it on (obviously) to their, say, 2 girls. Now half the population has it. Again, they pair up, and both men pass on the predisposition to the future generation, and now the whole population has it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Obviously this is a *much* smaller scale, but it's comparable to our current world's situation. If you think the increase of rates for certain things is anything but mathematics and genetics, you're living a lie. One person with a random gene mutation passed that on to multiple people, and those people passed it on to multiple people, and now we're here. Exponential rates can start out increasing in tiny increments, but then get to the billions in the blink of an eye.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Commondreams is such a bullshit organization. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The ""deadline"" is ARBITRARY and determined by Democrats who have NO RIGHT to determine a ""deadline."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Barr has said that he will have it mid month. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Democrats and media are complicit in inciting unrest over bullshit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that the reason things are the way they are now (with a special prosecutor report) is because of DEMOCRATS...namely Janet Reno: [linebreak]  [linebreak] After the Starr report was released, the power of the independent counsel's office was reined in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During Congressional hearings about the rules in the spring of 1999, Reno called big final reports a ""problem."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""We believe that information obtained during a criminal investigation should, in most all cases, be made public only if there is an indictment and prosecution, not in lengthy and detailed reports filed after a decision has been made not to prosecute,"" Reno told Congress at the time. ""The final report provides a forum for unfairly airing a target's dirty laundry.... We have come to believe that the price of the final report is often too high."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] So in the summer of 1999, the old law was allowed to quietly die, and Reno's DOJ put new regulations in place, which have governed Mueller's entire investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are the reason his final report isn't yet public. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The title: ""independent counsel"" became ""special counsel."" That word change signified a major shift in the power and independence granted to the position. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The process: The new rules put more power in the hands of the attorney general — including the right to decide how much of the investigator's concluding document would ever see the light of day. Specifically, the old rules had called for the independent counsel to submit a report directly to Congress that documented any ""substantial and credible information that an impeachable offense may have been committed"" — a standard Ken Starr himself later described as a ""surprisingly low threshold of evidence."" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The power: Now, the only thing that the attorney general had to share with Congress was a notification that the special counsel's investigation was over, and a list of every time the AG had overruled the special counsel.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] And the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that the reason things are the way they are now (with a special prosecutor report) is because of DEMOCRATS...namely Janet Reno: [linebreak]  [linebreak] After the Starr report was released, the power of the independent counsel's office was reined in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During Congressional hearings about the rules in the spring of 1999, Reno called big final reports a ""problem."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""We believe that information obtained during a criminal investigation should, in most all cases, be made public only if there is an indictment and prosecution, not in lengthy and detailed reports filed after a decision has been made not to prosecute,"" Reno told Congress at the time. ""The final report provides a forum for unfairly airing a target's dirty laundry.... We have come to believe that the price of the final report is often too high."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] So in the summer of 1999, the old law was allowed to quietly die, and Reno's DOJ put new regulations in place, which have governed Mueller's entire investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are the reason his final report isn't yet public. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The title: ""independent counsel"" became ""special counsel."" That word change signified a major shift in the power and independence granted to the position. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The process: The new rules put more power in the hands of the attorney general — including the right to decide how much of the investigator's concluding document would ever see the light of day. Specifically, the old rules had called for the independent counsel to submit a report directly to Congress that documented any ""substantial and credible information that an impeachable offense may have been committed"" — a standard Ken Starr himself later described as a ""surprisingly low threshold of evidence."" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The power: Now, the only thing that the attorney general had to share with Congress was a notification that the special counsel's investigation was over, and a list of every time the AG had overruled the special counsel.

And several teams brought him in for workouts, but ended up not signing him, because he wanted too much money and didn't want to be a backup.  Basically, he either wanted to be a guaranteed starter and get paid, which was never gonna happen, or continue to portray a martyr for social issues and garner support/attention/money that way.

No. You will see that all he wanted to do was divide people more by giving both the left and the right a nudge, and the media, governments, and internet did exactly what he wanted.

This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment"". [SEP]","Speaker2: No one ever links SSRIs (which most shooters are on at the time) to the mental downfall of the shooters. Just as mentioned, it's swept away and always steered into another direction. [SEP] Speaker3: The massacre at Columbine High School took place on April 20, 1999. Astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word ""drugs."" Then the issue was opened. Eric Harris, one of the shooters at Columbine, was on at least one drug. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The NY Times of April 29, 1999, and other papers reported that Harris was rejected from enlisting in the Marines for medical reasons. A friend of the family told the Times that Harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. And then several sources told the Washington Post that the drug prescribed as treatment was Luvox, manufactured by Solvay. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In two more days, the ""drug-issue"" was gone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Luvox is of the same class as Prozac and Zoloft and Paxil. They are labeled SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). They attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. Luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft, and it was approved by the FDA for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Prozac is the wildly popular Eli Lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. It is now given to young children. Again, its chemical composition is very close to Luvox, the drug that Harris took. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Peter Breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (Toxic Psychiatry, Talking Back to Prozac, Talking Back to Ritalin), told me, ""With Luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. Mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. Mania can go over the hill to psychosis."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Joseph Tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in Washington DC. He is the president of the Washington chapter of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians. Tarantolo states that ""all the SSRIs [including Prozac and Luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. He becomes less empathic, as in `I don't care as much,' which means `It's easier for me to harm you.' If a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Arianna Huffington's syndicated newspaper column of July 9, 1998, Dr. Breggin states, ""I have no doubt that Prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. I've seen many cases. In a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on Prozac. And manic psychosis can lead to violence."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] A study from the September 1989 Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, by Joseph Lipiniski, Jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on Prozac developed what is called akathesia. Symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the ""jerking of extremities,"" and ""bicycling in bed or just turning around and around."" Dr. Breggin comments that akathesia ""may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... Akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... The June 1990 Health Newsletter, produced by the Public Citizen Research Group, reports, 'Akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on Prozac.'"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other studies: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""Emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [Prozac] treatment,"" published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by RA King, RA Riddle, et al. It reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. [linebreak]  [linebreak] July, 1991. Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Hisako Koizumi, MD, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on Prozac: ""full of energy,"" ""hyperactive,"" ""clown-like."" All this devolved into sudden violent actions which were ""totally unlike him."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] September, 1991. The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Author Laurence Jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. Becoming depressed, the boy is put on Prozac by a doctor. The boy is then ""hyperactive, agitated ... irritable."" He makes a ""somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities."" Then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. The Prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The well-known Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics reveals a strange fact. It states that Ritalin [given for ADHD] is ""structurally related to amphetamines ... Its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines."" In other words, the only clear difference is legality. And the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. You take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. You become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In his book, Toxic Psychiatry, Dr. Breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: ""Combining antidepressants [e.g., Prozac, Luvox, Paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., Ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. Withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression."" Children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 1986, The International Journal of the Addictions published a most important literature review by Richard Scarnati. It was titled, ""An Outline of Hazardous Side Effects of Ritalin (Methylphenidate)"" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of Ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.

"Speaker1: My condolences. The best advice I can give you is to exercise, eat healthy (try the Keto/Carnivore diet). This is critical, as you do not want to be dependent on the medical cartel and their toxic Pharmaceuticals. Avoid any chemical dependence or drug use. Use herbal remedies or alternatives whenever possible. DO NOT isolate yourself. Take care of your appearance and never neglect your grooming even if suffering from fatigue or depression. Be visible in your community and live your life (want to see a concert? Go see the concert). Believe NOTHING that is ""said"" to you from ""them."" Be peaceful in nature, slow to anger and avoid conflict whenever possible. ALWAYS carry self-protection. Remember, you're not a victim and you're not a punk. Most important, focus on self-improvement and your spirituality. Find a church, mosque, temple, etc. to involve yourself with.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Remember, the trick is to get YOU to be your own downfall (It's a game of plausible deniability). Completely ignore any threats because if it's your time, it's your time. Try your best not to show any visible signs of your inner turmoil. Share little personal information to strangers or coworkers, etc., but always appear positive and be helpful and courteous. Listening to a lecture, having a movie in the background, or music can definitely help drown out all the ""static"", especially when trying to rest or sleep.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's all easier said than done. This is your personal cross to carry.

I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the litter bit fat doozi. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The other laowai's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror.

And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The other laowai's xiaoshi had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the CoolPad flashlight and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The laowai was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then carefully an meticulously put each of the pieces inside the empty Chamion Pizza dlivery boxes littering the floor. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door.

An elderly neighbor, a former Red Guard, who was faemers in the neighborhood for throwing eggs at monks and smashing a Yuan Dynasty Buddha carving had reported that a laowai lived next to them, and that the police should see if they are spies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The laowai, I mentioned, hway low jyah luh. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.

The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""Villains!"" I shrieked, ""dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] \-THE END- [SEP] Speaker4: [linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very ""meng"" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there?"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!"". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --""It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner,"" or ""I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute."" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little –covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

[linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] If we were sensible, we'd have a truly progressive tax system where the percentage depends on one's income. This is because if you tax a billionaire at 20% he's still a billionaire, but if you do the same to someone who's working class that puts them in the red. So the rich should be taxed more because they are in a better place to handle it financially. That revenue then would get used to fund programs like single-payer health care, taxpayer-funded higher education, fixing our water supplies (see Flint Michigan) rebuilding infrastructure etc. And this does not even cover the worker exploitation that happens here.

"Speaker1: The thing about aces is that they're fighting erasure. Like the existence of true aces, with literally no libido and no sexual attraction of any kind to anyone, is pretty much not even acknowledged in most cases. It's brushed off as low libido, closeted homosexuality, or a lifestyle choice rather than an actual difference in brain chemistry. You actually did just that in your comment. The difference between an ace and choosing celibacy is that you don't choose to be ace, you just are. It's not deciding your sexuality is nothing, it's that your sexuality really is nothing. There's a pretty big difference between choosing celibacy because you think it's moral, desire be damned, and choosing celibacy because you flat-out lack those sexual desires. Your argument has a lot of the same points as people used to say about gay people ""choosing"" to be gay. Most of us are so steeped in hormones making us want to fuck that we literally cannot imagine not wanting sex at all ever, and being surrounded by the expectation that they're like that even after saying they're ace makes some aces wind up feeling like aliens on a foreign planet.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Tl;dr Aces are generally ignored and/or invalidated at every turn even by other people with sexualities in the same boat, it's justified by basically saying ""But it's not a sexuality to not want sex so they should be excluded,"" and that's a shitty, nitpicky attitude. Sexuality is just the name for your answer to ""What are you sexually attracted to?"" and ""nothing"" is an answer other than ""the opposite sex,"" so aces should be included. They are by definition not heterosexual. [SEP]","Speaker2: What I'm saying is that they don't do anything different really. There are so many reasons people are celibate. I don't see why choosing to be celibate specifically as sexuality puts you under the same umbrella as a group of people who have been persecuted for their sexual choices. I don't see the relation, I don't see why they need to be includded in that umbrella when they weren't part of that expereince. I'm not saying it's not a valid thing, if you don't want anything to do with sex that's cool, but I don't see what that has to do with the pride movement. [SEP] Speaker3: Being celibate doesn't necessarily mean you're ace. I know guys who dated, liked it just fine, and just felt the priesthood was their calling and not marriage. Vice versa, too. My cousin married a guy who spent 2 years of their relationship debating whether or not he was going to go into the seminary. I know a woman who was a nun for 7 years, left before her final vows, and married a guy who left the seminary before becoming a priest. There's a pair of saints who were married, had like 12 kids, and became a monk and a cloistered nun after their kids grew up.

Speaker1: Did you just say gay people are a gender. [SEP],"Speaker2: I don't understand what you mean by this, but the phrasing seems to imply that gay people cannot exist. [SEP] Speaker3: Because evolution has not paved the way for more than two neurological pathways associated with sex and behavior.

[SEP] Speaker4: Why are there only two genders? [SEP] Speaker5: This man gets it [SEP]",Neutral,Abusive Speech
"Speaker1: You must admit asexuality has more to do with LGBT than irritable bowel syndrome, since it's at least somewhat related to sexual attraction. Whether you see it as an orientation (aces are attracted to one fewer gender than straight and gay people) or as a defect (the part of their brains that would cause them to feel sexual attraction is broken) is almost immaterial, given that most of them can't change that fact about themselves. For the ones who can, and are willing, the diagnosis of hyposexual desire disorder exists for that reason, and isn't going away (one would hope), but the rest of them still deserve the chance to achieve satisfaction from relationships in their lives.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Whether they do this as members of the LGBT community, their own separate community, or by assimilating into mainstream society is another matter entirely. I myself have mixed feelings on this. I'm not convinced that if people came up with LGBT today it would necessarily include aces, but I also don't see how letting them stay would do any more damage to the community than the failed attempts to remove them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also I can understand the romantic relationships are mostly a cultural construction, but you're still always going to get some people who inherently aren't a good fit for their culture, whatever tribe it is that they're are born into. So aromantic is definitely a thing i that regard. Are you saying it's not a thing, or just that it's inappropriate to describe it with LGBT terms? [SEP]","Speaker2: Well for one, there is a good chance there is something wrong with you if you have no sexual attraction to anyone. You may be asexual, but you may also have a hormonal imbalance or other underlying medical condition you should have investigated. Also, what you're describing is the human condition. There isn't a person alive that hasn't thought there was something wrong with them. I don't think thats a unique experience in the slightest. We may as well include people with IBS or underactive thyroids in the LGBT umbrella if this is the bar being set.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Secondly, there is no such thing as aromantic. That is not an orientation. Romantic partnering is a cultural creation, not a biological reality. This has been studied. There is a great deal of variability from culture to culture. Some cultures have primarily homosocial intimate pairings and sexual relationships are separate and primarily for procreation and recreation. So aromantic is not an orientation at all. [SEP] Speaker3: I've heard people (even on this sub) say they got bullied for it, which is not necessarily specific to asexuals (people can be bullied for just about anything), but I thought it worth mentioning.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally I decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because I started dating and I didn't feel like I could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so I thought ""if I'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone I might date in the future, what's the point,"" so now I just identify as female.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is now why I am so against tumblr identity politics. It's really messed up to see these kids go through what I had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. I've seen plenty of people who used to identify as ""demiromantic lithrosexual bigender"" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through. Tumblr encourages this and shames people who disagree even though it's toxic and can set people who actually want to find an identity back a good 2 years.

I used to be an sjw, so I would have sjw friends and we would and say stuff like this pretty frequently online but not irl. Usually insanity like this stays on the internet. For a long time, also, I used to identify as genderfluid, but I would only say it online and not in real life because I was afraid of being made fun of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] TLDR most people who write stuff like this on the internet won't admit to it IRL [SEP] Speaker4: Honest question: I moved to China from the UK last May. To what extent do these people appear in real life, as opposed to just on Tumblr blogs?

"Speaker1: I'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously I'm at my final straw. Next year I'll be 30 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for myself. When I was a teenager in college I was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. Fast forward to today, and I'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. My parents both moved out of the country when I was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. I found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. Fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. I'm still in the same field, although I am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. Other than that minimal progression, I haven't done jack shit with myself. I still live in the same basement apartment that I've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is I don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. I'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. At the end of the work day, I come home and am absolutely wiped. I barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before I pass out and get ready for the next day. I've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. I'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. I love to draw and to write fiction. I've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. I love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. I basically live in a fictional world in my mind. I use TV shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and I know I should be doing something else instead, but I don't know what. My old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally I'm still in the same place I was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. Thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. I still talk, act, and feel like I'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and I don't even know how the fuck I got here. Granted many of my high school friends had opportunities I didn't, but I can't keep using that excuse forever. People start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. Why can't I do the same? I had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me I should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. Thing is, I've been working the last 9 years. My mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. I'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... Who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? Apparently many people do, but I'm just not one of them. As I mentioned earlier, I am an introvert by nature. I need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else I'll be a complete mess the next day at work. It may sound like an excuse, but It's not. True introverts will know exactly what I'm talking about. So to wrap this whole thing up, I'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? How will I ever be able to retire if I don't have a profession in hand? I don't want to lead this life anymore. I need help, I need a direction, and I need advice. Any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. I'm real, no need for fluff.

"Speaker1: In commemoration of the 10th anniversary of Minecraft's official release, I have decided to type this open letter to the Mojang staff, in the hopes that notch (who, despite being a moderator, I am not allowed to ping) might relay it to a Mojang employee or group of employees who he may still be in contact with (I could email it to them, but I doubt anyone would ever read it), however the sale of the company may have negatively impacted their relationship. Here is the letter: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dear Mojang, [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am /u/ImJustaBagofHammers, a devoted fan of your game and active player on the official Minecraft of the subreddit that your own founder - who, if you are reading this message, most likely sent it to you - moderates. Though you have probably not heard of me, I have found it necessary to type this letter. I have been an avid admirer of and participant in your game, Minecraft, for many years. I have made great memories and developed useful skills in my escapades on both my singleplayer worlds and on various servers. I have played and made adventures maps. I was a devoted follower of many of the classic Minecraft YouTubers. I give sole credit to this game for my interest in engineering and in applied physics. It is because of the devotion of people such as myself that your game became the most successful the world has ever seen. Indeed, it is because I appreciate your game that I am so greatly distressed by its current direction, specifically by how it exposes your hypocrisy, apathy, unethical and potentially even illegal behavior, and contempt for the Minecraft community. To illustrate this point, I really could analyze any recent update, but I've decided to focus on 1.14 in particular. Though this letter's structure may seem disorganized, and its contents irrelevant, I hope that it, harnessing your piercing intellects, will be able to illuminate the problems of such aspects of the current state of your game as those of you who still have consciences have ignored. I will of course not comment on every last change or addition made in the update, and I will barely acknowledge the positive changes because, frankly, they are almost all very subtle and long overdue. Now, without adieu: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Playing through the latest update, I was struck by your hypocritical design philosophy. I noticed two particular examples of this; I will begin with the more benign (which I feel is probably the result of apathy), and then discuss the far more sinister one. The more harmless example is the new stonecutter block, whose model features a sawblade. You have rejected many suggested features (rightly, in my opinion), such as mining hats, for ""not fitting with the Medieval theme of Minecraft"". Why then did you add this? However, this issue is massively overshadowed by another; a new mob you added to the game is the fox. As an ambient mob, I quite like the fox. That said, I strongly object to the ability to take foxes. Foxes are frequently kept as pets, which causes them to live out depressing and anxious lives, as they, of course, are not domesticated animals. Why would you encourage children and even clueless adults to participate in this incredibly inhumane enterprise, especially considering that you yourselves removed the ability to tame parrots by feeding them cookies out of a concern for the wellbeing of parrots, and in this very update removed polar bears from the list of mobs required for the monsters hunted advancement? I can assume only that you have some financial interest in promoting the wild fox pet trade, which, if true, is quite disappointing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The new update makes many changes to villagers and villagers, both by redesigning villagers and by adding a new mob: the pillager. As you are without a doubt aware of the changes, I will not bother to list them all here. I appreciate many of the quality-of-life changes to villagers, and I can tolerate the changes to villager profession selection (though it complicates some of my challenge maps); I take issue only with the changes to villager appearance. I admit that my objections are not wholly rational, but I wish there they retained their classic appearance in at least one biome. At any rate, the other visual changes surpass them in both consequence and malice. With regard to villagers, I take greater issue with pillagers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I must admit that pillagers seem halfhearted. From the beginning, I was skeptical of ""raider villagers"", but I thought the idea might work as long as the raids didn't happen automatically without possibility of prevention (and indeed, they do not). However, I think there was a missed opportunity to make pillagers a new kind of villager rather than a new kind of illager. If they were villagers, they would be neutral to the player by default and players would potentially have the ability to ally themselves with them. In this case, they would also be mutually-hostile with zombies. You might say that you couldn't promote raiding in a children's game, but by the very design of Minecraft, the player is able to do heinously evil things; for example, it is possible to directly burn child villagers to death if you like. Therefore, I don't see how joining raider gangs would be much worse. You could even make the gangs take over settlements instead of indiscriminately slaughtering everyone (except the children, who can prolong a raid by several minutes as the pillagers wait for them to grow up so they can kill them, which could have been solved if you made them kidnap to raise them as pillagers) make it seem better. As it stands now, however, pillagers are simply a new enemy. While adding new enemies isn't inherently bad, I feel you could have done more. Lastly, it should be possible to exterminate pillagers from an area. Pillager patrols should spawn only if there is an active outpost in the area, and the pillagers in an outpost should have to rebuild their population by breeding or by raising kidnapped baby villagers. In the current version of your game, there is no way to eliminate organized crime if you try to create a civilization encompassing multiple settlements, and, since pillagers are automatically hostile, no way to travel without being attacked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In addition to these things, you've added a new villager-like mob; the wandering trader. Though I admire its advanced AI and complex behavior, it should not have been added to the game. All it does is sell the player biome-specific items, which, since it always spawns near a player, eliminates the incentive to explore, a major and lauded feature of your game. I cannot imagine you really thought this would ""help"" players who didn't want to explore for resources; creative mode and commands exist for that. The only way it could conceivably be useful is on a large anarchy server where all resources within large areas have been depleted. However, because it always spawns next to a player, and there is a cap of one per world at a specific time, most players will never see it on a large server. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now I would like to briefly comment on another new mob: the panda. I would find it quite peculiar that you spent valuable time making them one of the most complex mobs in the history of the game, having sets of alleles that combine to manifest as varying phenotypes, when they have practically no function, the only practical function, so far as I can see, is collecting slimeballs in peaceful difficulty (baby pandas sometimes sneeze in a reference to the long-dead internet meme and drop slimeballs as a result). However, I do not, for I believe I have the depressing answer; the People's Republic of China. You would be far from the first corporation to pander to China at the cost of the immediate value of your own property. The PRC is infamous for its use of ""panda diplomacy"" to improve its international image; I have to wonder if they worked out an arrangement with to ease their restrictions on Minecraft (which isn't outright illegal) in exchange with cooperation with this agenda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The previous supporting paragraphs have avoiding directly addressing one of the most controversial and damning elements of the new update; the texture changes. In this paragraph, I will address it, along with another, comparatively minor, change. To the shock of many, you took it upon yourselves to completely redesign every last texture in the game (except for that of the creeper, which is preserved for being ""iconic""). Yes, you did not make them the default (though you plan to from the next update onward), and currently have no public intention of making them mandatory without mods. Nevertheless, they are a window into your future plans for the game. It is obvious what you hope to achieve by changing the textures (with seemingly no support) from their iconic classic designs (which is so ubiquitous that most people can probably picture them in their head on command) to generic ones that, if I may be honest, make Minecraft look like a free-to-play mobile knockoff of itself. You want to make Minecraft into a bland, mobile-style game that any five-year old can pick up and play with for hours doing nothing of value. If the game's character, colored with the heart and soul poured into by its creators and which reflects the neurodiverse individuals who finally found an outlet in it, must die for this, then so be it. When you have had your way, Minecraft will no longer by a life-redefining experience that inspires those pushed to the edge by society to achieve greatness, it will no longer by a game in which thousands make creative and challenging puzzles and adventures for everyone to enjoy, it will no longer be a game that inspires artists and engineers; it will be game where children build models of penis out of TNT and laugh as they blow them up. To this end, you have redesigned the textures, simplified the game, and even changed the dye system, because usually ground-up bones for white dye apparently gave the game too much personality. You have made your contempt for the neurodiverse no secret; you even condescendingly renamed the classic textures to ""programmer art"". Its blatancy would be laughable if it wasn't so appalling. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With all that said, I should stress that your game is not beyond saving. If you wish to take my advice to heart, you must remove the sawblade from the stonecutter's texture and the ability to tame foxes (but may keep them as an ambient mob), make player-pillager relations more dynamic, remove the wandering trader, cut any illicit ties you may have formed with repressive regimes, and, last but not least, reverse the trend of ""simplifying"" the game.

"Speaker1: I was thinking about the Antarctic Treaty and it specifically lays out things we consider progressive or Green.

[SEP] Speaker3: The disconnect between what women SAY they want and what they actually DO want reflects the principle of ""alpha fux beta bux"" at not just a microscopic scale, but also a macroscopic scale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At a microscopic level: the individual woman takes Sheryl Sandberg's advice, fucks around with a long procession of different guys, then settles down with the stable provider she'd denied her attention in her youth. This may or may not include her bringing kids from a previous relationship (with some Chad) into marriage with this provider. And this may or may not include smoldering resentment that she couldn't rope Chad into marrying her, and thus cheating and/or divorce with alimony/child support from our dumb provider. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At a macroscopic level, though: ""alpha fux beta bux"" closely resembles the dysgenics explored in the movie *Idiocracy.* It's a known statistical trend that fertility is inversely correlated with income and education: men and women are too busy ""focusing on their careers"" to fug, make babby, and leave behind the next generation. The shekels that get skimmed off their paychecks fund food stamps and Section 8; the additional sales tax coin charged for their ""furbabies'"" sweaters fund welfare for single moms; the property tax money applied to their trendy but ever more cramped apartments or condos funds classes for the children of illegal immigrants and trailer trash. All this takes place via a combination of consumerist ideology (think about your next vacation to Europe or your next car loan, not about how your neighborhood is getting worse), media domination (movies where men ""man up"" by subsidizing the mistakes of others; say something too out of line with this status quo, get mobbed by Blue Checkmarks and terminated from your job), and school indoctrination (do you think that unionized public school teachers, with skin in the game, will legitimately present the cons of property taxes or the ever-increasing numbers of DACA or anchor baby students?) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just as individual women expect the future presence of dependable betas who never realize ""It is better to be alone, than in bad company,"" the world increasingly demands the subservience of societal beta providers who never ask questions like ""What am I really getting out of my taxes? When did I ever get a say in the changes happening around me? Who is really benefiting from these changes?""

"Speaker1: >There are some people who realize that the physical evidence indicates that the official story is wrong, but don't understand what purpose or interest the government may have had in carrying out the attacks and thus have a psychological relation to the entire event as remaining quite mysterious even though the government's claims are patently absurd. I'll resolve that for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/11/91 Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order. Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. What could he be up to? [linebreak]  [linebreak] >As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep. Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton. Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc. You can educate yourself on those details. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This scandal goes mainstream around 1986. In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.'s treasury secretary. Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich. Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time. Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion. He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda. Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich's personal money laundering machine. This manifests ten years later. If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don't have any real settlement issues. There is one major exception however: Mogilevich's money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it's balances without a record. It's worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? What were they used for? This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse. You'll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like The Money Plane in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. It's estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene. He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. Next thing you know 9/11 happens. There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I'd like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying ""Angel is next,"" angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* ""Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?"" Fleischer: ""Yes, I can. That's correct.""(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won't be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended) [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.

"Speaker1: [linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very ""meng"" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there?"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!"". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --""It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner,"" or ""I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute."" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little –covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

"Speaker1: And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the litter bit fat doozi. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The other laowai's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The other laowai's xiaoshi had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the CoolPad flashlight and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The laowai was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then carefully an meticulously put each of the pieces inside the empty Chamion Pizza dlivery boxes littering the floor. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three jingcha shooshoo, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity.. An elderly neighbor, a former Red Guard, who was faemers in the neighborhood for throwing eggs at monks and smashing a Yuan Dynasty Buddha carving had reported that a laowai lived next to them, and that the police should see if they are spies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The laowai, I mentioned, hway low jyah luh. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, put a maidanglow bag on top of the pizza boxes and nongfu quan bottles filled with my urine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""Villains!"" I shrieked, ""dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] \-THE END- [SEP]","Speaker2: [linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously –I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very ""meng"" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --""Who's there?"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!"". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --""It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner,"" or ""I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute."" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little –covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

Speaker1: Not a holocaust denier just read about it realized it didnt happen the way the said like when Auschwitz changed their sign from 4 million dead to 1.5 million. That kind of brings the 6 million into question. To deny there were no atrocities that occurred during WW2 to Jews would be stupid. There is overwhelming evidence of it. Was it blown way out of proportion? Yes. Is there evidence of it? Yes. If you believe 6 million Jews were killed then you have a differing opinion than Auschwitz.

People make mistakes and having sex is not like buying a car. It sometimes happens spontaneously and with primal urges. It's easy to say or should have worn a condom but talk like that solves nothing because it will happen millions of times today.

Like a woman was walking down the street and ""BAM"" she's pregnant. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of the outcomes of having sex is you could get pregnant. I don't see why you should be able to end a life because you accepted but ignored the risks. No other aspect of life or law in America gives you second chances or ""do-overs"" like that with no repercussions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I was always super careful when having sex to not get anyone pregnant. Yeah, I would have loved to not use a condom here and there or whatever, but the risk was to high IMHO. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except for rape and incest pregnancies, which are extremely rare, most women who get an abortion were just having sex with no birth control and just hoping for the best. I don't believe that should give you a free pass to kill a fetus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention, if a man commits a violent crime against a pregnant woman, it is considered even more heinous than if the woman was not pregnant. So obviously the law already gives weight to an unborn baby. A jury will treat someone who shot a woman in the stomach different than someone who shoots a pregnant woman in the stomach. So people do value a fetus, it's just mental gymnastics to allow abortions and think it's perfectly fine.

"Speaker1: Well for one, there is a good chance there is something wrong with you if you have no sexual attraction to anyone. You may be asexual, but you may also have a hormonal imbalance or other underlying medical condition you should have investigated. Also, what you're describing is the human condition. There isn't a person alive that hasn't thought there was something wrong with them. I don't think thats a unique experience in the slightest. We may as well include people with IBS or underactive thyroids in the LGBT umbrella if this is the bar being set.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Secondly, there is no such thing as aromantic. That is not an orientation. Romantic partnering is a cultural creation, not a biological reality. This has been studied. There is a great deal of variability from culture to culture. Some cultures have primarily homosocial intimate pairings and sexual relationships are separate and primarily for procreation and recreation. So aromantic is not an orientation at all. [SEP]","Speaker2: I've heard people (even on this sub) say they got bullied for it, which is not necessarily specific to asexuals (people can be bullied for just about anything), but I thought it worth mentioning. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Beyond that, the two biggest problems asexuals seem to face are 1) not knowing it's possible to be asexual and thinking there is something wrong with them if they don't want sex, and 2) loneliness in adulthood. This applies to aromantics as well. Both groups blame society for the second one because of how romantic relationships are normalized to the exclusion of other relationship types (I'm told keeping friends can be difficult when everyone else in your group is married), and romantic relationships after one's teenage years are expected to involve sex. [linebreak]  [linebreak] True, the oppression aces face doesn't remotely compare to a gay or bi person being killed for their sexuality, but it also isn't nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is not to be confused with the ***totally valid oppressions*** (read that with a heavy dose of sarcasm) of being kicked out of the LGBT community... *for not being oppressed enough*, and not seeing enough people like themselves in fiction and the media.

Age of lunacy i tell you, and this is actually very recent, if you look up most buzzwords these folks like to use on google analytics, youll see that most of the words started gaining publicity after 2015. [SEP]","Speaker2: Well I identified that way from about age 14-16. I never would have if I hadn't been on tumblr. I'm designated female at birth, and I never liked being a girl, mainly because of the way our society and past societies have treated women. Also, I was always a bit of a ""Tom boy."" So I thought the label ""genderfluid"" fit what I was going through. Some days, I would feel masculine, and some days I would feel feminine and want to be perceived as such. I now realize those feelings were probably a result of me going through puberty.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Side note: I also identified as asexual when I was 14. I think this is really messed up, as most 14-year-olds are too young to think about sex, yet being on tumblr and seeing that culture told me it was ok to identify that way and I wasn't too young to know I was asexual. It turns out I was just a lesbian with repressed feelings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally I decided to stop identifying as genderfluid because I started dating and I didn't feel like I could adequately explain it on a dating website (yes really), so I thought ""if I'm not serious enough about this to explain it to someone I might date in the future, what's the point,"" so now I just identify as female.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is now why I am so against tumblr identity politics. It's really messed up to see these kids go through what I had to go through because they were impressionable and misinformed. I've seen plenty of people who used to identify as ""demiromantic lithrosexual bigender"" when it turned out they were just gay or trans or even bisexual but they were young and wanted labels and didn't quite understand what they were going through.
