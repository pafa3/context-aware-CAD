"Speaker1: I'm the last person to come on here and write a long winded post, but obviously I'm at my final straw. Next year I'll be 30 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for myself. When I was a teenager in college I was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. Fast forward to today, and I'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. My parents both moved out of the country when I was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. I found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. Fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. I'm still in the same field, although I am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. Other than that minimal progression, I haven't done jack shit with myself. I still live in the same basement apartment that I've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is I don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. I'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. At the end of the work day, I come home and am absolutely wiped. I barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before I pass out and get ready for the next day. I've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. I'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. I love to draw and to write fiction. I've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. I love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. I basically live in a fictional world in my mind. I use TV shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and I know I should be doing something else instead, but I don't know what. My old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally I'm still in the same place I was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. Thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. I still talk, act, and feel like I'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and I don't even know how the fuck I got here. Granted many of my high school friends had opportunities I didn't, but I can't keep using that excuse forever. People start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. Why can't I do the same? I had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me I should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. Thing is, I've been working the last 9 years. My mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. I'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... Who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? Apparently many people do, but I'm just not one of them. As I mentioned earlier, I am an introvert by nature. I need my 2-3 hours a night to recharge mentally or else I'll be a complete mess the next day at work. It may sound like an excuse, but It's not. True introverts will know exactly what I'm talking about. So to wrap this whole thing up, I'm going on 30 and have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. I think about this every day and am worried for the future. 30 got here so fast, what'll happen once 40 hits? How will I ever be able to retire if I don't have a profession in hand? I don't want to lead this life anymore. I need help, I need a direction, and I need advice. Any advice, no matter how harsh is appreciated. I'm real, no need for fluff. If you think, i'm a pathetic loser piece of shit who can't help himself, by all means say so. I can handle it. What do I do to make a better future for myself?

[linebreak] >  [linebreak] > * Physician-assisted suicide, where the physician provides the patient with the means to end their own life. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > Late last year, this girl approached the End of Life clinic in The Hague with a question of whether she qualified for either of those. She was refused. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > [In her own words:](https://www.gelderlander.nl/home/noa-16-uit-arnhem-is-nu-al-klaar-met-haar-verwoeste-leven~a01a7bd1/) [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > ,,Ze vinden me te jong om dood te gaan. Ze vinden dat ik de traumabehandeling moet afronden en dat mijn hersenen eerst volgroeid moeten zijn. Dat duurt tot je 21ste. Ik ben er kapot van, want zo lang kan ik niet meer wachten.''

[linebreak] >  [linebreak] > In American medical literature, this is something that's commonly referred to as [VSED](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=vsed): voluntary stopping eating and drinking. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > VSED is a common alternative to euthanasia in places where euthanasia is illegal, because it ""exploits"" a simple but fundamental principle: consent. Patients have the right to refuse treatment, after all. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > It's used as an alternative to euthanasia in the Netherlands as well. And as [the Dutch Medical Association's guidelines](https://www.knmg.nl/advies-richtlijnen/dossiers/bewust-afzien-van-eten-en-drinken.htm) note: [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Under the Medical Treatment Contracts Act, a patient has the right to receive clear information from the physician about his medical condition, the prognosis and treatment options. Based on the information provided, the patient can either choose to grant or not grant care providers consent to provide treatment, nursing or care. A patient always has the right to decide against treatment, nursing and care, or against specific aspects thereof. Should the patient not grant consent, the care providers may not provide treatment, nursing or care. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > Obviously, there's a way to get around that in case of mental illness: by getting a court order for involuntary treatment. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > In fact, [this girl had already undergone involuntary treatment on several occasions](https://www.gelderlander.nl/home/noa-16-uit-arnhem-is-nu-al-klaar-met-haar-verwoeste-leven~a01a7bd1/) after several failed suicide attempts: [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Noa werd in de afgelopen jaren heel vaak opgenomen, in ziekenhuizen, instellingen en specialistische centra. Met afgrijzen denkt ze terug aan dwangopnames in instellingen voor jeugdzorg. Ze droeg er alleen een scheurjurk, een jurk zo sterk dat die niet verscheurd kan worden. Een noodmaatregel om haar er van te weerhouden dat ze zichzelf van het leven berooft. De opnames hebben een traumatisch effect. ,,Nooit, nooit ga ik meer in de isoleer. Het is mensonterend.'' [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Dwangmaatregelen zijn vernederend, zegt Noa. Ze zal nooit vergeten hoe ze naar de Arnhemse rechtbank werd gebracht, waar rechters besloten over gedwongen opname in een behandelcentrum. De aanblik van de 'mensen in toga's' maakt een diepe indruk op haar. 'Ik voel me haast een crimineel, terwijl ik mijn hele leven nog niet eens een snoepje heb gestolen uit een winkel', schrijft ze in haar autobiografie. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > Translated: [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Noa has been admitted very often in recent years, to hospitals, institutions and specialist centers. Horrified, she recalls involuntary admissions to youth care institutions. She could only wear a tear-proof dress - an emergency measure to keep her from committing suicide. Being institutionalized had a traumatizing effect on her. ""Never, never will I go into isolation again. It's degrading."" [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Coercive measures are humiliating, says Noa. She will never forget how she was taken to the Arnhem court, where judges decided on involuntary admission to a treatment center. The sight of the ""people in gowns"" stayed with her. ""I almost feel like a criminal, even though I haven't so much as stolen a piece of candy in my life,"" she writes in her autobiography. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > And last year: [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Nog niet zo lang geleden werd ze in kritieke toestand, met ernstig ondergewicht en de dreiging dat vitale organen zouden uitvallen, opgenomen in ziekenhuis Rijnstate in Arnhem. Ze is zelfs in coma gebracht om haar met een sonde kunstmatig te kunnen voeden. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > > Not too long ago she was admitted in critical condition to a hospital in Arnhem, severely underweight and at risk of having vital organs cease functioning. She was even put into an induced coma so she could be fed through a feeding tube. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > Now, back to last week. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > She was refusing to eat and drink, which left her care providers with three choices: [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > 1. Force-feed the patient, saving her life for the moment at the cost of further infringing upon her bodily autonomy, with the near-certainty that it won't be the last time. Even assuming that she will eventually recover, you're looking at years of involuntary treatment and confinement of the kind that would traumatize even a person without mental health issues. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > 2. Do nothing and let her die in pain. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > 3. Provide her with pain relief. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > In the end, this time, they decided to take the third option. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > You could argue that they should have picked the first option, and given her age, I might even be inclined to agree with that. [linebreak] >  [linebreak] > But this wasn't euthanasia - it was a choice not to force a patient to undergo involuntary treatment.
