[linebreak]  [linebreak] It seems like 5 weeks would be the worst case, not the best. What if she got pregnant 2 weeks after her last cycle, wouldn't she miss her next one? [SEP]","Speaker2: You obviously don't know that pregnancy is counted not from the day of conception but from the first day of a woman's previous menstrual cycle. So the first point that a woman with a clockwork-like cycle (which many if not most women don't have) could realize she might be pregnant would be close to the 5 week mark. That would give her a week to make a doctor's appointment, schedule an abortion, allow for waiting periods that anti-choice lawmakers have instituted, etc. Not realistic, which is why these rules are being out into law by anti-abortion forces. [SEP] Speaker3: Well what about plan B in the next couple days? You can buy that anywhere now and its cheap [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or at least have an abortion in the first few weeks. Even all of these so called ""heartbeat"" abortion bills still allow abortion in the first 4-6 weeks I believe [linebreak]  [linebreak] A person would literally have to make ""mistakes"" everyday for a couple months to end up with an unwanted baby. Even then you still have adoption as an option [SEP] Speaker4: Casual sex happens and when it happens to teenagers without fully developed brains they do stupid things like forget to pull out or wear a condom. People make mistakes and having sex is not like buying a car. It sometimes happens spontaneously and with primal urges. It's easy to say or should have worn a condom but talk like that solves nothing because it will happen millions of times today. Hold people accountable with life long punitive damage to them and all involved(the baby). JC once said, ""He who is without sin shall cast the first stone."" Have any of the pro lifers made a mistake or sinned? [SEP] Speaker5: I know it's a shitpost, but what I've noticed is that getting pregnant is being treated like it's a random event that just occurs. Like a woman was walking down the street and ""BAM"" she's pregnant. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of the outcomes of having sex is you could get pregnant. I don't see why you should be able to end a life because you accepted but ignored the risks. No other aspect of life or law in America gives you second chances or ""do-overs"" like that with no repercussions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I was always super careful when having sex to not get anyone pregnant. Yeah, I would have loved to not use a condom here and there or whatever, but the risk was to high IMHO. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except for rape and incest pregnancies, which are extremely rare, most women who get an abortion were just having sex with no birth control and just hoping for the best. I don't believe that should give you a free pass to kill a fetus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention, if a man commits a violent crime against a pregnant woman, it is considered even more heinous than if the woman was not pregnant. So obviously the law already gives weight to an unborn baby. A jury will treat someone who shot a woman in the stomach different than someone who shoots a pregnant woman in the stomach. So people do value a fetus, it's just mental gymnastics to allow abortions and think it's perfectly fine.

"Speaker1: My condolences. The best advice I can give you is to exercise, eat healthy (try the Keto/Carnivore diet). This is critical, as you do not want to be dependent on the medical cartel and their toxic Pharmaceuticals. Avoid any chemical dependence or drug use. Use herbal remedies or alternatives whenever possible. DO NOT isolate yourself. Take care of your appearance and never neglect your grooming even if suffering from fatigue or depression. Be visible in your community and live your life (want to see a concert? Go see the concert). Believe NOTHING that is ""said"" to you from ""them."" Be peaceful in nature, slow to anger and avoid conflict whenever possible. ALWAYS carry self-protection. Remember, you're not a victim and you're not a punk. Most important, focus on self-improvement and your spirituality. Find a church, mosque, temple, etc. to involve yourself with.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Remember, the trick is to get YOU to be your own downfall (It's a game of plausible deniability). Completely ignore any threats because if it's your time, it's your time.

Come on lads, we learned this early on. **Correlation does NOT equal causation.**  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Allergy rates and cancer rates and autoimmune disorder rates all that jazz are rising. Well no shit, Sherlock. The population is increasing rapidly, and the people genetically predisposed to these conditions reproduce and create more who are genetically predisposed.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Obviously this is a *much* smaller scale, but it's comparable to our current world's situation. If you think the increase of rates for certain things is anything but mathematics and genetics, you're living a lie.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I never understood how my friends could be so irresponsible.  When I was poor, I was able to go to PP for a $60 exam and was prescribed a $9 birth control.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] It's even easier now with morning after pills, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Let's set aside rapes incest and dangerous pregnancies. They don't account for 80% or so of the convenience abortions.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] What those 80% are really saying is they lacked the self control and were too unintelligent to plan ahead to 1) abstain 2) have oral sex instead 3) have sex but use a condom 4) have sex but use the pill 5) have sex but use a diaphragm 6) have sex but use a morning after pill.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are literally a half dozen other choices that could have prevented their situation. [SEP] Speaker4: I know it's a shitpost, but what I've noticed is that getting pregnant is being treated like it's a random event that just occurs. Like a woman was walking down the street and ""BAM"" she's pregnant. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of the outcomes of having sex is you could get pregnant. I don't see why you should be able to end a life because you accepted but ignored the risks. No other aspect of life or law in America gives you second chances or ""do-overs"" like that with no repercussions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I was always super careful when having sex to not get anyone pregnant. Yeah, I would have loved to not use a condom here and there or whatever, but the risk was to high IMHO. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except for rape and incest pregnancies, which are extremely rare, most women who get an abortion were just having sex with no birth control and just hoping for the best. I don't believe that should give you a free pass to kill a fetus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention, if a man commits a violent crime against a pregnant woman, it is considered even more heinous than if the woman was not pregnant. So obviously the law already gives weight to an unborn baby. A jury will treat someone who shot a woman in the stomach different than someone who shoots a pregnant woman in the stomach.

I'll resolve that for you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/11/91 Bush Sr. spoke before Congress calling for a new world order. Alright, so the president is announcing a major initiative to the world. What could he be up to? [linebreak]  [linebreak] >As the USSR was collapsing, there were major operations underway to seize control of their industry. We need to lay down a little historical context for those unaware before proceeding. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Throughout the 1980s the CIA was heavily involved in cocaine and arms trafficking, money laundering, etc. The most famous name here might be Oliver North, but Bush Sr. is neck deep. Mena, Arkansas is a major hub for this operation under the jurisdiction of Bill Clinton. Long trail of deaths surrounding North, Clinton, Bush, Mena, etc. You can educate yourself on those details. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This scandal goes mainstream around 1986. In 1989 you get the first major form of collateralized debt obligations in the form of Brady Bonds, invented by Bush Sr.'s treasury secretary. Minimally informed people are aware of the centrality of CDOs to the 2008 financial panic and the endemic fraud to securities trades of this type. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >One of the Bush/North associates is Neil Livingstone, who acts as a go between to Semion Mogilevich. Mogilevich is one of the biggest mafia leaders in the USSR at the time. Mogilevich has had money laundering through the Bank of New York exposed to the tune of $10 billion. He is a major arms dealer at the time, and also heavily connected to al-Qaeda. Part of a bargain Livingstone tried to broker with DoJ involved Mogilevich handing over a bunch of his al-Qaeda connections. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Around 9/11/91 a bunch of fraudulent Brady Bonds are issued through the Bank of New York, Mogilevich's personal money laundering machine. This manifests ten years later. If you go back and look at the settlement imbalances at banks after 9/11, even the banks operating out of WTC complexes don't have any real settlement issues. There is one major exception however: Mogilevich's money laundering hub, the Bank of New York, is reporting book imbalances in excess of $100 billion per day following the attacks. The rules governing security clearance were lifted immediately after 9/11 - allegedly due to widespread problems - but really just to allow BoNY to clear it's balances without a record. It's worth noting that BoNY did not sustain structural damage on 9/11 - not in the WTC. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So these 100s of billions of fraudulent securities that were not clearing in the days after 9/11 - where did they come from? What were they used for? This is how the west launched their invasion of Russia following the collapse. You'll find exposes about crates of freshly printed US bills being shipped to Russia like The Money Plane in NY Magazine, used to buy influence; the other side of this is the securities fraud used to buy assets. It's estimated that something like 40-50% of Russia had been bought up through the mafia by late 92 or 1993. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >In 2000/2001 Putin comes onto the scene. He starts nationalizing Russian assets that were seized by the US via the above mentioned securities fraud / money laundering and putting pressure on the mob. Next thing you know 9/11 happens. There are a lot of bones to pick with the official story, but rather than taking up those issues I'd like to highlight the importance of some officially acknowledged but underreported facts. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >On 9/9/01 Ahmad Massoud is assassinated by a fake TV crew that disguised a bomb as a TV camera. Two days later the secret service denies access to a couple of guys claiming to have an interview lined up with Bush in Florida on the morning of 9/11. This is our first direct threat against Bush of the day and indication of some larger plot than hijacked planes. Upon learning of the attacks, Bush insists on returning directly to Washington. In flight, a threat is received in the form of a call from an unknown source saying ""Angel is next,"" angel being code for the president that only insiders would have. (* ""Can you confirm the substance of that threat that was telephoned in...that Air Force One is next and using code words?"" Fleischer: ""Yes, I can. That's correct.""(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won't be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended) [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] And the left is absolutely too fucking damaged and propagandized to understand that the reason things are the way they are now (with a special prosecutor report) is because of DEMOCRATS...namely Janet Reno: [linebreak]  [linebreak] After the Starr report was released, the power of the independent counsel's office was reined in. [linebreak]  [linebreak] During Congressional hearings about the rules in the spring of 1999, Reno called big final reports a ""problem."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""We believe that information obtained during a criminal investigation should, in most all cases, be made public only if there is an indictment and prosecution, not in lengthy and detailed reports filed after a decision has been made not to prosecute,"" Reno told Congress at the time. ""The final report provides a forum for unfairly airing a target's dirty laundry.... We have come to believe that the price of the final report is often too high."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] So in the summer of 1999, the old law was allowed to quietly die, and Reno's DOJ put new regulations in place, which have governed Mueller's entire investigation into Trump's ties to Russia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are the reason his final report isn't yet public. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The title: ""independent counsel"" became ""special counsel."" That word change signified a major shift in the power and independence granted to the position. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The process: The new rules put more power in the hands of the attorney general — including the right to decide how much of the investigator's concluding document would ever see the light of day. Specifically, the old rules had called for the independent counsel to submit a report directly to Congress that documented any ""substantial and credible information that an impeachable offense may have been committed"" — a standard Ken Starr himself later described as a ""surprisingly low threshold of evidence."" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  - The power: Now, the only thing that the attorney general had to share with Congress was a notification that the special counsel's investigation was over, and a list of every time the AG had overruled the special counsel.

How could we possibly expect it to succeed in raising children during their most crucial stages of development?  How can you support said system? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Furthermore over and over again we hear how our government is not not screening  the adopted parents well enough to insure the child isnt just being miked. That's if they don't just end up disappearing. How many mass child graves have been found beneath orphanages?

That is not ""the woman's body"". That is an entirely separate life.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that if a baby can live outside of the womb at 20ish weeks, it is ok to kill?   [linebreak]  [linebreak] You know. I'd consider compromise on drawing the line at 3 months if that meant no abortions after that except for medical emergency. [SEP] Speaker3: You are 100% correct. There are other choices. But  the person didnt choose them. And the end result is a life is brought into this world to be fed into a broken system that is not catered to the individual.

Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called Orion, the CIA inculcated the desire in these people to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the antigun lobby. This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment"". [SEP]","Speaker2: No one ever links SSRIs (which most shooters are on at the time) to the mental downfall of the shooters. Just as mentioned, it's swept away and always steered into another direction. [SEP] Speaker3: The massacre at Columbine High School took place on April 20, 1999. Astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word ""drugs."" Then the issue was opened. Eric Harris, one of the shooters at Columbine, was on at least one drug. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The NY Times of April 29, 1999, and other papers reported that Harris was rejected from enlisting in the Marines for medical reasons. A friend of the family told the Times that Harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. And then several sources told the Washington Post that the drug prescribed as treatment was Luvox, manufactured by Solvay. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In two more days, the ""drug-issue"" was gone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Luvox is of the same class as Prozac and Zoloft and Paxil. They are labeled SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). They attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. Luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft, and it was approved by the FDA for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Prozac is the wildly popular Eli Lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. It is now given to young children. Again, its chemical composition is very close to Luvox, the drug that Harris took. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Peter Breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (Toxic Psychiatry, Talking Back to Prozac, Talking Back to Ritalin), told me, ""With Luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. Mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. Mania can go over the hill to psychosis."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Joseph Tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in Washington DC. He is the president of the Washington chapter of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians. Tarantolo states that ""all the SSRIs [including Prozac and Luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. He becomes less empathic, as in `I don't care as much,' which means `It's easier for me to harm you.' If a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Arianna Huffington's syndicated newspaper column of July 9, 1998, Dr. Breggin states, ""I have no doubt that Prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. I've seen many cases. In a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on Prozac. And manic psychosis can lead to violence."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] A study from the September 1989 Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, by Joseph Lipiniski, Jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on Prozac developed what is called akathesia. Symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the ""jerking of extremities,"" and ""bicycling in bed or just turning around and around."" Dr. Breggin comments that akathesia ""may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... Akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... The June 1990 Health Newsletter, produced by the Public Citizen Research Group, reports, 'Akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on Prozac.'"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other studies: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""Emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [Prozac] treatment,"" published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by RA King, RA Riddle, et al. It reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. [linebreak]  [linebreak] July, 1991. Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Hisako Koizumi, MD, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on Prozac: ""full of energy,"" ""hyperactive,"" ""clown-like."" All this devolved into sudden violent actions which were ""totally unlike him."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] September, 1991. The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Author Laurence Jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. Becoming depressed, the boy is put on Prozac by a doctor. The boy is then ""hyperactive, agitated ... irritable."" He makes a ""somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities."" Then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. The Prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The well-known Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics reveals a strange fact. It states that Ritalin [given for ADHD] is ""structurally related to amphetamines ... Its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines."" In other words, the only clear difference is legality. And the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. You take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. You become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In his book, Toxic Psychiatry, Dr. Breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: ""Combining antidepressants [e.g., Prozac, Luvox, Paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., Ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. Withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression."" Children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 1986, The International Journal of the Addictions published a most important literature review by Richard Scarnati. It was titled, ""An Outline of Hazardous Side Effects of Ritalin (Methylphenidate)"" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of Ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] The light is love. That starts with self-love, love of your family, your tribe, your village, your state, your country, and yes eventually the world.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not trying to steal anything from you, I'm trying to give you something. The people who are stealing from you have you mad at the wrong people. The so-called citizens of your own country have shipped all your money overseas and imported sad people.

You don't enjoy what ""die-hard liberals"" tell you, you don't enjoy watching strangers enter what you see as your home. You live in fear that you are the last on the list of priorities. There is a new path, where you can put yourself first, and really start to enjoy the gifts that you have been given.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I understand you may not get me, and my words may fail. But there is another way of viewing your gifts. Our ancestors called this ""Indian giving."" But this was a cultural failure to understand wise people who understood that gifts are not things to be hoarded but to be passed on.

Therefore guilt should drive all Americans to hand over their hard earned (i.e. stolen) money to every third world country in Central and South America.
