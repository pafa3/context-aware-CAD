But still, it's apparently an inexcusable evil when a company chooses to release a game on a store that isn't The Holy Steam Of Our Lord And Saviour Gaben. This sounds suspiciously like a double standard.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages ""choice"" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides ""hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!"") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. Save your money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[linebreak]  [linebreak] As with all societal trends it's complicated but I think media plays the most significant role.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Movies, TV, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. Even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  And heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead I think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. Even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is an element of health involved. No doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but I think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that I find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of Americans. At this moment, some 2/3rds of Americans are overweight or obese.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this AITA post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and I'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  >Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely. Especially I think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.

I never have meet anyone who actually hated obese people. Sure its annoying when people who are literally dying from obesity are shouting at you that they are healthy at any size which of course is one the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Really, are we going to pretend anorexia and bulimics are healthy? No, so we should not pretend that people who weigh 300 pounds are healthy either, there is not a single piece of evidence that being fat is good for you, while there is literal mountains of evidence that being in good shape with low body fat is associated with health and longer life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't see this hatred of the overweight you speak of, just because someone isn't attracted to you and doesn't want any type of relationship with you due to your inability to take care of yourself does not mean they hate all fat people. Personally I would never be with someone who is not in good shape, for a few simple reasons. 1) I take excellent care of my body and physical activity is a passion of mine, so if my s/o isn't into an active lifestyle we just wont match. 2) I want a life partner who isn't going to die in the first 50 years of their life from cancer or heart disease. 3) I'm just not physically attracted to overweight people, plain and simple, doesn't make me a bad person for having a personal preference. I work extremely hard for my low body fat % and muscles and it makes me happy, I'm much more confident, outgoing and energetic when im taking care of my body.","I really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people. The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course.",occamsshavingkit,"Just for the record OP there was a girl and both her and the overweight girl come off as pretty much your classic high school mean girls... however OP comes off as a bigger asshole because she made the post to basically pat herself on the back and get validation from a bunch of sexist, fat-hating male Redditors.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, the overweight girl may have personally insulted OP, but it was just her saying she was ugly... when OP then made an instagram poll, it was basically all her classmates at once calling the overweight girl ugly.

This is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. Obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. You cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. Not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. Cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. They're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, ""oopsie"" when something unexpected happens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] A car is predictable. In most cases, a car will be on the road. Unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. Driving has rules. You stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks I think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. It doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point A to B. This usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (If ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. A pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. With a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. Together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. This means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. In my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to ""how do I avoid a pedestrian"". Some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. That last category is the jerks.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The solution to this is actually having more bike tracks and cyclists rather than less.

He interrupted her and said  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >""You and I may have a disagreement on this,"" Sanders said, ""because it's not just black, and it is Latino, there are areas in America, including poor rural areas, where it is white.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Another classic example of Bernie's deliberate cluelessness when it comes to race is is [this series of tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/794941635931099136) in which, three days before the election in 2016, he said Trump supporters are not racist and everyone else has a responsibility to reach out the Trump supporters and build a better society for them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another great example was when he said [""There are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American.""](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-on-andrew-gillium-and-stacey-abrams-many-whites-uncomfortable-voting-for-black-candidates).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My personal favorite, which is to say least favorite, is the time that an audience member at one of his appearances said she wants to become the second Latina Senator in US history, and he cut her off to say [""It's not good enough for somebody to say 'hey I'm a Latina vote for me' that is not good enough.""](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/94221972)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] One that's less serious but still deeply concerning to me personally is this [piece of creative writing from him where he describes a woman being bound and gang-raped in graphic detail. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) I really just don't trust men who fantasize about abusing women.

[His healthcare plan](https://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/1/19/sanders-plan-republican-wet-dream-womens-health) involves Medicare for all, but it does not involve repealing the Hyde Amendment. Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funds cannot be used to pay for abortion. If his proposed healthcare plan was put into place, it'd become even harder for women to access abortions than it already is,  because there would no longer be private insurance carriers.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if he improves his plan, he's shown repeatedly that he just doesn't value women's reproductive rights that much. In 2016, when Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary Clinton, he said [""I have friends in Planned Parenthood, but you know what, Hillary Clinton has been working with them for a long time, and some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment.""](https://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/1/19/unfit-to-lead-bernie-sanders-pp-hrc) He tried to turn Hillary Clinton's past work with Planned Parenthood into a negative.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] In 2017, [he campaigned for an anti-abortion democrat](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/trump-democrats-abortion-litmus-test.amp.html) in Nebraska.

I think that's wrong because a person's right to bodily autonomy is absolutely mandatory. Being anti-choice should be a dealbreaker for the Democratic Party, every time, no matter what.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] It's crazy how so many Americans (particularly young voters) thought and still think he's some sort of pure newcomer that doesn't have the problems that other presidential candidates do. They say he's not corrupt, represents the working class, truly connects to people, and would bring sweeping changes such as large taxes on the one percent and free college.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In reality, Sanders is irresponsible, lacks the pragmatic ability to put ideas into practice, and has remained grossly over-simplistic on the economy, race, international affairs, and other issues. His personal history speaks volumes to his ineptitude as a candidate. In particular, his lack of significant work to show his commitment to politics and the country.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] His actions are self-centered (e.g., continuing to campaign when he had no chance of winning and continuing internal strife within the Democratic Party, etc.), immature (e.g., as though every thing that happened in the country was primarily some sort of rigged, systematic injustice carried out by elitist individuals who control everything. And, seriously, ""Feel the Bern?"" is your campaign slogan? Not to mention all the ridiculous memes portraying him this way. Because everyone knows memes are well-justified, valid arguments about knowledge.), and in many ways more dangerous than Trump's actions, in my opinion. And he's a socialist.

Here, let me give you some advice: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 1 - Just roll into Boss attacks mostly, their attacks are really telegraphed so even with garbage reaction times you should still see em coming. For most common hollows, don't lock on, run past them, pivot and backstab (their tracking is really shitty so you can dance circles around their attacks). You can also run straight to the boss rooms since you get iframes on going through fog walls. Learn your parry timings, especially on Black Knights and Gwyn, the greatsword ones are the easiest due to how telegraphed their attacks are. Don't wear heavy armor and always fast roll unless you got that sweet 76 poise and a high stability greatshield. Oh, and always kill the dogs first. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 2 - The PVE in this game is cancer, but you should be in this game for the PVP.

The community seemed more like a group of first responders from all walks of life rather than a cesspool like liveleak or bestgore. By banning these subs, the website is essentially pushing its members directly towards these cesspools too. I've found the discord and saidit have been comforting but I'm waiting to find all the past members we've lost. It's disheartening.

Fuck, I hate how preachy some sides of the fandom are about GRRM's pace of writing. This, right now, is the longest the series has gone without a new book (no, the side projects don't fucking count THANKS), and I don't care how ghoulish it makes me to complain about it.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I complain about that *and* hate the show too because I like to have my cake of pure hatred and eat it too.","Speaking as an impotent book purist we're just pissed off that he'll never finish the series, but complaining about it makes us look like ungrateful ghouls waiting for him to kick it, so we just dump on the show instead",dayafternextfriday,"The impotent nerd rage is what this post is about.

Considering what an overwhelming writerly feat that is, it's no wonder it's taking him so long to finish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I like both the TV show and the books.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] As has been pointed out many times over the past few years - it's pretty strange that 'the highest grossing film of all time by far' is a one-off oddity from 2009 whose story and characters had almost no cultural impact. People struggle to remember the names of almost any character in the film, there are no memorable quotes from it in the pop cultural lexicon, no scenes or plot concepts getting referenced or homaged, nobody walking around in Avatar t-shirts, etc. Compare it to Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, E.T., Jaws, Titanic, Batman, Frozen, or any other cultural and financial *phenomenon*, and its content is a total obscurity. Even Shrek and Pirates Of The Carribean had a way bigger pop culture impact, for their first couple films anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Point being, it's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way that the highest grossing movie in the entire 100-year history of the medium has, for a decade now, been one that's significant almost entirely for a camera gimmick. Even other films like The Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars and Jurassic Park which are similarly famous for their gamechanging technological breakthroughs *also* had iconic stories, characters and dialogue which have long outlasted the novelty of their SFX. [linebreak]  [linebreak] An Avengers film *finally* topping Avatar at the box office feels more like a victory for common sense than brand loyalty, because the *content* of the Marvelverse has had all the ubiquitous cultural impact that Avatar lacked, and it's nice to know that more human beings have connected with something like that, than just been roped into going to the theater for some 3D hype alone.

So why I'm not going to say he isn't good, obviously his movies hit a chord with many people, but in terms of horror movies I'd argue say he's mediocre when compared to something like Hereditary. Of course I also understand why his movies gain wider appeal, hereditary is in no way fun.","Peele is pretty good. Get Out was a good movie but *WAY* overhyped. Us was suspenseful, but the plot made no sense and the twist was obvious. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, fun fact, the skill of a writer or director has nothing to do with race. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also also, how does ""look at the 'great' American authors,"" prove that white people make formulaic shit?

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Also also also, white people don't make formulaic crap, corporations do. Look at Black Panther, for example.

Mine is literally just old people doing tai-chi and kids in the playground.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which park is your park? unless its too identifiable, i already know three things about you",The park I go to is crowded on the daily.,Harmonex,"Yeah, like being connected to nearly every single person in the world in a giant network is a thing of beauty.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's just that, i went to the park today, and like no one between the ages of 10 to 50 were there, people just don't do stuff as much. My phone was broken so i couldnt really do much else, and i realised what ive been missing, maybe its just that i personally had a phone addiction, but i just wish no one else was on their phone and everyone would just be out doing stuff, like who sits on park benches anymore ? Where i live there are benches throughout and no one sits on them. idk just ranting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] and yeah, like you said, these Apps are designed to be addictive, having these things go unchecked is bad for society. Like for me, i spend so much time on my phone that its like procrastination for things i actually want to do, like watch TV or play video games, i still havent started GOT yet because all i do is just go from reddit to twitter to 4chan and then freecell when everything else has been exhausted",SBGoldenCurry,"I agree in some capacity, but I feel like it's not quite so straightforward.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but I think it's important to examine why that is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but I think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow that's a lot of text.

He said a YouTuber and the alt-right were ""faggots"" and ""acting like n*ggers"" in showing him disrespect because ""white people are supposed to be polite. You act....exactly like you describe black people acting"".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And no, it's not okay to use the n-word as an insult just because you're talking to racists. That 'context' doesn't make this okay. He wasn't talking to them on 'their level.' He was being a racist.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] ###More Racism [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""But over halfway into the [two-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74llFWdeKNM), Benjamin seemed to lose his patience for the discussion.

It's not personal — no one really thinks you're a n*gger."""" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Paedophilia [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""In 2017, Benjamin interviewed a Singaporean blogger called Amos Yee for his podcast, The Thinkery Podcast, where the two discussed scrapping the age of consent for sex. During the interview, Yee argued it ""should be fine"" and ""completely reasonable"" for adults to have sex with 13- or 14-year-olds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""It's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this,"" Benjamin said. ""Because in, I think probably this country, we're in America at the moment and in Britain the age of consent is 16. If you were to say something like, 'Well, I think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""It's actually not as controversial as you think,"" Benjamin said. ""For example, I think in the Netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14.

Literally every does. Maybe I was actually wrong to say people ""hate women"". Hating women isn't an internal thing or a state of being, it's just that misogyny is a thing you do. And a thing everyone does. It's not an individual issue, it's a societal one. We live in a very misogynistic society, and no one is immune to social conditioning.

If it can happen to me, I know there's tons of people out there who must be even MORE susceptible. That's why it's important to always call out and discuss it. We need to recognize the problem to fix it. I hate misogyny in me, and I also hate misogyny in other people. Again, it is not an individual thing.

The thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  I have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  I will try to dig up the OECD data, but I found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the United States. However, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Also, the Australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. This is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. It helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.

There's the argument that America has the best health care but it's not like our working class are on platinum/gold-plated plans nor our mentally ill and substance addicts given access to long-term luxury rehab with tons of aftercare and post-recovery support (pardon the snarkiness but I do want to hear answers from you though I know I'm not going about it as politely as I ought to be)?","I agree that single-payer would be terrible.  The thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  I have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  I will try to dig up the OECD data, but I found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the United States. However, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Also, the Australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. This is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. It helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Single-payer system would actually be horrible. The only country I'm aware of that has the single-payer system liberals seem to talk about is Canada.

It's certainly achievable, but it's not going to be a simple fix by passing a bill that says the government pays for everything. We will need to tackle tort reform, because litigation costs around 4% of all medical expenses. We would also have to address the fact that  medical school is a lot more expensive in the United States, which means doctors have to charge more to their patients to cover their student loans. We also need to be realistic about the fact that we have a much higher obesity rate than other countries, which adds another 2% to 7% of  our total healthcare costs.

[linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Regarding subpar care, while that argument might work with some middle and upper middle class voters (older ones too who see their own morality), uninsured folks and people with crappy plans they still have to pay would take a risk for a chance for any coverage and care ?

[linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] That said, as someone with an eye on health care systems around the world, how do you think the US can fix its own system and stop being the mockery or object of derision/concern for the rest of the world who not only seem to ""cover"" everyone (even if it ain't perfect) but do it in a more affordable manner too? There's the argument that America has the best health care but it's not like our working class are on platinum/gold-plated plans nor our mentally ill and substance addicts given access to long-term luxury rehab with tons of aftercare and post-recovery support (pardon the snarkiness but I do want to hear answers from you though I know I'm not going about it as politely as I ought to be)?",Communitarian_,"I agree that single-payer would be terrible.  The thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  I have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  I will try to dig up the OECD data, but I found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the United States. However, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Also, the Australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. This is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. It helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Strictly speaking, my issue isn't with technology - technology is a dumb object, but humanity is a dumber object and has only managed to hurt itself with the power tools. The shed remains unbuilt. My issue is with civilisation, and largely rests on my belief that civilisation has failed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like if you were simulating a financial market, but when you click ""run simulation"", instead of running the simulation, the machine wipes your entire dataset, hard faults, and power cycles. Human civilisation has completely failed to attain any of the meaningful goals set out for it. It's a large-scale tribalist shitshow led around by marketeers because we, as a species, don't understand how to leave other tribes alone and let them be as they want to be, and we're far too eager to jump onboard anything that lets us feel smug about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Note that, while I advocate for the destruction of computers, I say nothing about the machinegun or high explosives.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My position, as it is, lies somewhere between the most far-right of right-wings (constitutional imperialism when?!) and extremist accelerationism. I want to see all the groups, all the tribes, big and small, arm themselves to the teeth and then go at it hammer and tongs. There are lessons that humanity needs to learn, and they're not going to learn them out of a fucking book. They're also not going to learn them without incurring a few bruises, and the sooner they make peace with that particular fact the better.

Offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hyperpolarisation the US is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   There is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.

[linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.

Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.

That's a good point. I have no reply to this besides ""This fucking sucks."" :x","I agree to all that.  Destroying is not always needed but some kind of pressure must be applied.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Timing is everything.  The ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, Trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the Trump Train.  He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.   [linebreak] If the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   Trans people should try to be invisible until this government is gone.  And gays should dress and act like Mormons at Pride parades.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They should take a lesson from the neo-Nazis.  Do you see them dressed in their Nazi uniforms, goose-stepping and Sieg Heiling for the TV cameras, claiming the labels Nazi, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, holocaust denier, alt-right?  Nope. They define themselves out of any of those definitions, and deny that ""crypto-Nazi"" even means anything.  If you point out any similarities they say ""Nazis drink water"".   Also:  Nazis haven't existed since WW2.  Neo Nazis don't exist because Nazis were socialist and who wants that?   Nazis are not far-right because socialism, duh.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] They will presumably abandon ""identarian"" once the public learns what it means, or if they can't defend its nature as a form of the ""identity politics"" they decry.

You have a logical lead up to your conclusion and even arguments. That's more than most ""anti sjws"" have. [linebreak]  [linebreak] History reveals your words as bollocks, however. Every conquest, minor or major, ever made by a marginalized group was achieved not by being polite and appeasing the dominant groups, but by fighting and screaming and destroying.

History has proven time and again that violent riots bring progress, being complacent creates stagnation.",VinesNFluff,"The SJW principle that tone policing is not allowable is rubbish.  Tone policing is the rule in the real world and SJW's pious failure to use it internally just incubates a bunch of counterproductive messages and bad tactics, with bad results far wider than the concerns of the particular minority.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] A spectacular example is promotion of Black Lives Matter and trans issues.  Bathroom bills etc.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Russian troll factory fought both sides on trans issues, BLM and other divisive issues before the 2016 election, correctly judging they would work splendidly as wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trumpists agreed and pushed them hard.    They became incorporated into the very souls of a generation of youngsters.  Kids too young to have much clue about gender build their growing  identity out of ideas like ""There Are Only Two Genders"".   [linebreak] Those operations wedged a bunch of otherwise left-leaning people over to Trumpism.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know the story of BLM but I'm sure indiscipline and naivety by both BLM and perhaps more importantly its white supporters, handed Trumpists the kind of juicy source material that money can't buy.   I'm not saying BLM was not a good movement, just that they got played more than was necessary because of SJW degeneracy and incompetence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] For trans people SJWs' self-indulgent competitive wokeness has been a huge factory of material that Trumpists used simply by quoting it accurately with no comment.

Head over to /Honkler and /FrenWorld if you'd like to see fascists.,"You are now unironically using the word ""uppity"" to describe minorities, dude. I mean...dude. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But bringing antifa into the conversation is illuminating, because it makes you sound suuuuuper fashy, so it becomes clearer what your agenda is.",Babbit_B,"Everyone can be as uppity as they like but there are times when that can be counterproductive for their alleged goals.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd say Antifa are counterproductive every time they appear in public, in the current environment.   They handed Trump the term  ""alt-left"" on a plate, enabling his ""both sides"" story.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] An uppity Antifa gives a huge boost to the growing numbers on the right who have lost faith in democratic processes, see civil war as inevitable and need visible examples of what left wing targets would look like in practice.   Their previous visualisations would have been driving around in pickup trucks shooting hipsters and women with blue hair I guess.  Easy but unsatisfactory in various ways, more like pest destruction than the warfare and honest victory they crave.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Antifa gives them strong, violent men dressed in black, with helmets even.  Anonymous uniforms not people.  Weapons can easily be added so it could feel sort of like a fair fight.   Except the collective weapons and fighting experience of right wingers is such that they could melt the left by pissing on them, there would be no possibility of the left putting up a worthwhile fight.",cyathea,"You should just use the word ""uppity"" next time. It'll convey the same meaning and won't take as long to read.",Babbit_B,"No, not until you learn some manners.  Offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hyperpolarisation the US is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   There is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   There is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.   [linebreak] *Somebody* has to not-buy all those Gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is going to get a lot worse IMO.  Can Israel vs Palestine be implemented inside the US?  Why not?   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons Trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the US, sweeping all before it.   I'm picking a second term of Trump, with a handover to Pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.   [linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   [linebreak] You know that SJW cartoon of ""I'm not racist but ..."" where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says ""shush, nothing good ever comes after that""?    [linebreak] Whenever you catch yourself wanting to write ""white people"" or ""white males"", just shush yourself.  Never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  You can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  Supreme Court for a few decades.

That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a ""wrong"" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, ""would,"" as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.","I always hated the whole ""death of the author"" thing people always try to pull.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Aldonza, the peasant girl Don Quixote calls Dulcinea, is described as a mannish, rough-hewn woman (Aldonza was considered a rustic name, like how we in English view names like ""Bertha"" or ""Helga""). The subtext behind Don Quixote's fascination with her is suggestive of how some upper-class types viewed lowborn women as more promiscuous or sexual, because they weren't as delicate or bound by the rules of decorum as upper-class women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for other women, Don Quixote always operates on the assumption they're immediately smitten with him, and uses his devotion to chivalry and Dulcinea as an excuse to turn down their advances... despite none of them ever showing signs of interest. There's one chapter where a prostitute enters his room by mistake, he embraces her and tells her this, but it's dark and she doesn't understand his archaic language, so she attacks him in self-defense and a fracas ensues.

That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a ""wrong"" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, ""would,"" as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.",newyne,"I always hated the whole ""death of the author"" thing people always try to pull.

That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a ""wrong"" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, ""would,"" as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.",newyne,"I always hated the whole ""death of the author"" thing people always try to pull.

I'm looking at it from the perspective of finding the locus of meaning, and that, I think, (rather ironically), that is something that has a clear-cut answer. I'd also say that Death of the Author is the very reason we can apply so many schools of criticism to the same works. That is, it's the school that supports the idea that there's no right way to read a text, that we can look at it from all kinds of perspectives. I will say that some post-structuralists take it to an absurd extreme, by saying that authorial intent is irrelevant. Which, writing is all about communication, it's important to try to understand other people's thoughts and perspectives. I mean, if all you care about is your own, you're not learning or growing. That's why I prefer to think of it as ""Birth of the Reader."" But you know.","It should be noted that ""Death of the Author"" (which uh... is also a pun on Malory's ""Morte d'Arthur"" for some reason) came as a reaction to earlier schools of criticism: it is, itself, not something that's just ahistorical and timeless, nor is it ""The only right way to approach a text"" or some such: It is broadly useful, but not neccessarily in all situations and in all contexts.",Arilou_skiff,"Death of the Author stems from the fact that meaning is constructed by the reader. That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a ""wrong"" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, ""would,"" as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.",newyne,"I always hated the whole ""death of the author"" thing people always try to pull.

Few can define what it really means, since it's supposed to be something really really bad. The genuine basis for fascism is the petty bourgeoisie, wrote Leon Trotsky, suggesting it was the over- and middle-class tactic to 'hijack' the true revolution that has to come. A way for the 'parasites' (bourgeoisie) to hang on there in a changing world. 'Parasites' is a horrible word to use about people, but if one looks at nature at a tree fungus for instance and think coldly like a scientist, it isn't a bad analogue. It contributes nothing to the trees existance, and in the end will lead to the death of its host. [linebreak] I recommend Trotsky's writings on these matters, there is a book or pamphlet written before the second world war called ""What is National Socialism"" that is still interesting and highly readable.","America is Experiencing: THE EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF FASCISM"" According to Contrapoints poster.",2Manadeal2btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And one thing you might not know: Is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws FEDERAL to affect all males nationwide. So we need to be ready for that if it comes to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Controlled Mass Media: ^ Those sources I just mentioned, say the Soros funded propaganda sources like: BuzzFeed ""News"", Contrapoints, Young Turks type Youtube Channels & CNN ""News,"" are the biggest ""news"" sources in the country mostly. I put quotes around ""news"" because nowadays? There is no line between news and propaganda these days. This is INSANELY fascist, to a terrifying degree. And a ""professional news network"" like CNN, with the help of Cultural Marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that Cultural Marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (Obviously.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With White Supremacy: ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!!! Lol, but seriously...

[linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also worth mentioning: They don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed ""torture."" and ""inhumane."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: ""Gender-Fluid"" You know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... But they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (We'll get into that in a bit.) Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why? Maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... Well... Let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history.

Oh, you disagree with me? Well ""academics"" at this super lefty university said they are. Can you prove that academics didn't tell me that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is how fascists talk. It's all part of a game they play. ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR THIS TACTIC. Make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. They never have any. Ever. They only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. And then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you ""lost the argument"" or ""got banned LOL."" Never give them the satisfaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hammer them down on data and facts. Don't let them pivot. Don't let them argue in ""moral territory,"" because that's entirely ""subjective."" Moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like ""immoral."" For instance: ""Immigration Policy."" the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is ""immoral."" Just keep it in ""OBJECTIVE territory."" Don't budge. Don't show emotion. Just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. Prove that all they do is argue from feelings. Not ""FACTS"" and ""LOGIC!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah: ""Women are oppressed in America more than other countries,"" and ""It's impossible for black people to be racist,"" ""gender is a spectrum!"" etc. You can literally pretend social science is telling you ANYTHING. ""Culture Wars"" have been the most gruesome in existence. They think ""social science"" told us that women are oppressed. You say ""no, they're not..."" Then they say:""Can you prove that?!""

You need to stop. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am a bot. [Contact for questions](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=lightumbra),"-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because ""they're a private company they can do what they want"", and ""the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations"", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science ""white supremacy."" That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be ""fetishizing"". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's ""white supremacy."" Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as ""honorable,"" and/or ""necessary."" To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant ""We will not be silenced by your violence"" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side.",saint2e,"And, of course: Look at the media crucifixions recently... FULL COVERAGE FOR SMILING AT A NATIVE DUDE?! (Smirking is a form of violence, obviously.) AND JUSSIE SMOLETT GETS LET OFF THE HOOK? And the far-left (Fascist. They're fascists. It's a code word so we don't say a word associated with horrible atrocities. George Soros said that himself.) news sources, Jezebel/Young Turks/woke internet culture, CNN ""news,"" and countless Youtube propaganda channels: Are blatantly anti-man. And one thing you might not know: Is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws FEDERAL to affect all males nationwide. So we need to be ready for that if it comes to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Controlled Mass Media: ^ Those sources I just mentioned, say the Soros funded propaganda sources like: BuzzFeed ""News"", Contrapoints, Young Turks type Youtube Channels & CNN ""News,"" are the biggest ""news"" sources in the country mostly. I put quotes around ""news"" because nowadays? There is no line between news and propaganda these days. This is INSANELY fascist, to a terrifying degree. And a ""professional news network"" like CNN, with the help of Cultural Marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that Cultural Marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (Obviously.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With White Supremacy: ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!!! Lol, but seriously... We are terrified beyond rationality, because of the far left propagandists telling you that white people are responsible for all things wrong in the world and throughout history. And people become SO brainwashed that you're fine with them being falsely accused and losing their jobs if it's ""going to keep you safe and not hurt any feelings!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also worth mentioning: They don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed ""torture."" and ""inhumane."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: ""Gender-Fluid"" You know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... But they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (We'll get into that in a bit.) Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why? Maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... Well... Let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history. [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Religion and Universities Intertwined: The changing of the meaning of words are a thing because ""equality."" By the way, rocks and pebbles are microaggressions. Oh, you disagree with me? Well ""academics"" at this super lefty university said they are. Can you prove that academics didn't tell me that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is how fascists talk. It's all part of a game they play. ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR THIS TACTIC. Make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. They never have any. Ever. They only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. And then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you ""lost the argument"" or ""got banned LOL."" Never give them the satisfaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hammer them down on data and facts. Don't let them pivot. Don't let them argue in ""moral territory,"" because that's entirely ""subjective."" Moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like ""immoral."" For instance: ""Immigration Policy."" the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is ""immoral."" Just keep it in ""OBJECTIVE territory."" Don't budge. Don't show emotion. Just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. Prove that all they do is argue from feelings. Not ""FACTS"" and ""LOGIC!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah: ""Women are oppressed in America more than other countries,"" and ""It's impossible for black people to be racist,"" ""gender is a spectrum!"" etc. You can literally pretend social science is telling you ANYTHING. ""Culture Wars"" have been the most gruesome in existence. They think ""social science"" told us that women are oppressed. You say ""no, they're not..."" Then they say:""Can you prove that?!"" And the ""social science"" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse. And they could repeat that for an hour, and people in this country won't even think that's irrational and moronic at this point. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​",saint2e,"I think this will be EXTREMELY valuable in swaying people. As we fit into EVERY one of these to varying degrees. (Some of them 100%) One of the biggest problems it that the average American DOESN'T. KNOW. WHAT. THE. FUCK. FASCISM. IS... And that's a MASSIVE problem. So I'd like to create a very clear, modern collection of examples people can use as a reference. I would really love it, if this lovely community contributed their own thoughts or examples!... (From me, a supposed ""Nazi,"" Which is a term that has no meaning annymore. Lol.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Powerful and Oppressive Tech companies: We have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship. The definition of ""safety"" has become a dog-whistle of sorts, as well as the definition of ""violence,"" the definition of the phrase ""hate crimes,"" etc. Have all come to mean ""things I don't like,"" and have utterly racist and violent implications today. Google's ""Do the right thing"" implies that their employees know America is NOT doing the right things right now. But to openly question that would make them feel like a white supremacist/misogynist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Different Opinions: This is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: ""But people will suffer if this happens!"" They don't care. I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about ""spectrums"" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that ""these degenerates and undesirables"" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary ""social justice"" or ""dismantling"" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (Lmao.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Supremacy of the Media: Uh, yeah. Lmao. We have the LARGEST, most expensive media in the history of the planet. We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's ""moral"" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you ""immoral"" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to ""Learn to Code"", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: ""THIS IS HARRASSMENT! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEM!"" Card. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Rampant Sexism: Yeah. Men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. Men are harassed more than I've ever seen these days. Men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. False Rape Accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. Anita Sarkeesian said ""Believe all Women,"" to men who told her they've been falsely accused. And she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: ""Help!  Abuse!  Harassment!"" when they disagreed.  And this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. It ended up in: Jezebel articles everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And Feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying.

Comes to mind.)",saint2e,"America is Experiencing: THE EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF FASCISM"" According to Contrapoints poster.",2Manadeal2btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY TO HIDE IT. That is a RED FLAG, you guys... I mean, Google is saying they're going to rig search engine results and YouTube trending charts to avoid another Trump term... And even dishonest reasons sometimes. They don't have to tell the truth, they can do terrible things that screw the working class, they can wage unjust wars, they can take money from shady sources, and what are we going to do? It's like they're taunting us with that: ""Yeah, I just screwed you over, and everybody knows it was me. And I already have billions, but I felt like having a little bit more. And everybody knows I have all your information already. And nobody cares. What are you going to do about it?"" Kinda like how Google got rid of the euphemisms, and straight up started admitting banning people they don't like: ""ALT RIGHT!"" Hmm... You know what that sounds like? Jewish people. Only instead of stars of David, they'd better have their Democrat memberships on them, they're going to start banning more and more conservatives now, or they're going to be calls to their employers to fire them from their jobs, and their kids are going to be starving on dirt floors getting assaulted by Cultural Marxists accusing them of misogyny and white supremacy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, Cultural Marxists is going to be able to shred evidence of their atrocities easier as Google is starting to use their Authoritarian powers to get rid of the people warning us to prevent them from doing this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Fraudulent Elections: This is the iffy one. This is LUCKILY the one that isn't 100% certain. I know that the polls, as Noam Chomsky once said: ""Are designed to control the voters."" And influence how we vote. I know Google is going influence the next election. And I'm from California, one of the most liberal states in the nation: And THOUSANDS of people who were registered as ""Republican,"" as you had to be to vote for Donald Trump, were changed to either ""Liberal,"" ""Libertarian,"" or ""Independent,"" due to a ""glitch in the system."" (Hmmmmm.....) But that isn't a regular occurrence so much. I mean, Trump winning against a 20 year-congresswoman and former first lady is astounding. That one is still up for debate.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Different Opinions: This is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: ""But people will suffer if this happens!"" They don't care. I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about ""spectrums"" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that ""these degenerates and undesirables"" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary ""social justice"" or ""dismantling"" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (Lmao.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Supremacy of the Media: Uh, yeah. Lmao. We have the LARGEST, most expensive media in the history of the planet. We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's ""moral"" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you ""immoral"" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to ""Learn to Code"", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: ""THIS IS HARRASSMENT! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEM!"" Card. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Rampant Sexism: Yeah. Men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. Men are harassed more than I've ever seen these days. Men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. False Rape Accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. Anita Sarkeesian said ""Believe all Women,"" to men who told her they've been falsely accused. And she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: ""Help!  Abuse!  Harassment!"" when they disagreed.  And this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. It ended up in: Jezebel articles everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And Feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying. (Hillary Clinton once said: ""Women have always been the primary victims of war."" Comes to mind.)",saint2e,"America is Experiencing: THE EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF FASCISM"" According to Contrapoints poster.",2Manadeal2btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you fucking retards don't care WHAT FUCKING CONTENT IS POSTED AND WHERE IT'S POSTED THEN WHY NOT JUST POST A BUNCH OF BLANK PICTURES. The fucking comments are always full of these fake fucking hipsters who just fucking hate what's trending to hate and love whatever inoffensive shit they're spoonfed I fucking can't deal with it. Reddit has become a fucking dystopia where all the people are just copies of cunts who sit at coffee shops with their laptops every morning from 8-10. Meanwhile, you have this one fucking retard in the controversial denying the fucking holocaust like some fucking tinfoil wearing piece of shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fucking straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that r/waterniggas just got fucking quarantined for being offensive. This is a perfect example of taking shit out of context. THE FUCKING SUB IS JUST MEMES ABOUT WATER YOU SNOWFLAKE FUCKING TUMBLR REFUGEES. IF NO ONE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING THEN DON'T FUCKING ACT LIKE YOU'RE A BUNCH OF MARTIN LUTHER KINGS PURIFYING REDDIT OF ITS OFFENSIVE HATE SUBS! WANNA GET RID OF SOME FUCKING HATE SUBS THEN GET RID OF r/FragileWhiteRedditor for starters. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is that I can't fucking find a good replacement for Reddit. I tried going on Twitter but I don't fucking know it's not working. So I'm fucking stuck here in a fake fucking Utopia. This place is eating my sanity I can't fucking deal with it. Someone please PLEASE help me get away from this trash fucking website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Nevermind the real life attacks driven by incel culture that have already taken place, carried out by men that incels openly admire.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The other day I had a pedophile apologist on there telling me that incels  who idealize underage girls are just opportunistic and not ""real pedophiles"", because ""real pedophiles are afraid to hurt children and live in self-loathing."" Huh? If that were even remotely true, child sex trafficking would cease entirely. If it were remotely true, pedophiles would pose no threat to society. People really believe this virtuous pedophile shit. Not saying there are none who are like that and are seeking help, but this idea that MOST of them are just friendly guys who don't have any desire to act on their compulsions?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Deserves a second post. NO sympathy for self-identified incels. NO sympathy for pedophiles or mysoginists, Western or otherwise.

Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that ""You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes."" This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't think of any other time where mods have to remove as many *(highly upvoted!)* comments as they do when furries are mentioned. Reddit loves to hate hate hate, but a lot of of them aren't brave enough to hate on actual minorities. They risk a slight chance of backlash. So instead they choose the next best thing, an easier alternative that won't *(can't)* fight back. All the feelings of superiority of hating gays or brown people, but with none of the guilt or backlash! **Bonus**: most furries are bi and gay, le epic win xD! [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""It's all ironic bro! It's just jokes!"" Reddit's classic excuse to get away with saying anything. ""Edgy jokes"" is their only excuse. Yes, the tens of thousands of highly-upvoted comments across reddit calling for shootings, gassings, dehumanization and actual threats? All just a prank bro. Something is going to happen one day (well, happen *again*, remember a gassing already did) when another person is radicalized, probably a shooting, and they're going to deny any responsibility whatsoever.

That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans ""n[slur]""), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death.

He averages like 200,000k viewers on his YouTube channel where he discusses his actual political views. A number of those viewers also clearly l don't like him as often you can see top comments calling him a ""zionist shill"".

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow that's a lot of text.

It's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. And not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. It is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). This group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. The more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like JusticeServed and the now-defunct Cringe Anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to ""the other"". And this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. And, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a ""crazy feminist"". Though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the ""centrist"" h3h3/Rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, I do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. However, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. And, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. Incel culture needs to be countered, not justified. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I, personally, have my own problems with incelTears. I think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. And, too often, I think some also engage in a problematic ""Just World"" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. As a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful.

Destroying is not always needed but some kind of pressure must be applied.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Timing is everything.  The ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, Trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the Trump Train.  He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.   [linebreak] If the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] They should take a lesson from the neo-Nazis.  Do you see them dressed in their Nazi uniforms, goose-stepping and Sieg Heiling for the TV cameras, claiming the labels Nazi, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, holocaust denier, alt-right?  Nope. They define themselves out of any of those definitions, and deny that ""crypto-Nazi"" even means anything.  If you point out any similarities they say ""Nazis drink water"".   Also:  Nazis haven't existed since WW2.  Neo Nazis don't exist because Nazis were socialist and who wants that?   Nazis are not far-right because socialism, duh.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] They will presumably abandon ""identarian"" once the public learns what it means, or if they can't defend its nature as a form of the ""identity politics"" they decry.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are far less hidden since Trump came to power but mainly they lay low.

That's more than most ""anti sjws"" have. [linebreak]  [linebreak] History reveals your words as bollocks, however. Every conquest, minor or major, ever made by a marginalized group was achieved not by being polite and appeasing the dominant groups, but by fighting and screaming and destroying.

History has proven time and again that violent riots bring progress, being complacent creates stagnation.",VinesNFluff,"The SJW principle that tone policing is not allowable is rubbish.  Tone policing is the rule in the real world and SJW's pious failure to use it internally just incubates a bunch of counterproductive messages and bad tactics, with bad results far wider than the concerns of the particular minority.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] A spectacular example is promotion of Black Lives Matter and trans issues.  Bathroom bills etc.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Russian troll factory fought both sides on trans issues, BLM and other divisive issues before the 2016 election, correctly judging they would work splendidly as wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trumpists agreed and pushed them hard.    They became incorporated into the very souls of a generation of youngsters.  Kids too young to have much clue about gender build their growing  identity out of ideas like ""There Are Only Two Genders"".   [linebreak] Those operations wedged a bunch of otherwise left-leaning people over to Trumpism.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know the story of BLM but I'm sure indiscipline and naivety by both BLM and perhaps more importantly its white supporters, handed Trumpists the kind of juicy source material that money can't buy.   I'm not saying BLM was not a good movement, just that they got played more than was necessary because of SJW degeneracy and incompetence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] For trans people SJWs' self-indulgent competitive wokeness has been a huge factory of material that Trumpists used simply by quoting it accurately with no comment.

I'm picking a second term of Trump, with a handover to Pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.   [linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.

Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.

Interpretation of a work of art should be a sound evaluation of the work, not of what the author has said about the work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Take, for example, Ender's Game, and the rest of Orson Scott Card's Ender series. In Ender's Game, there's a real bent toward multicultural tolerance, anti-xenophobia, support and compassion, all sorts of positive themes, and this is starkly at odds with Scott Card, who is himself a pretty awful bigot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So the question, then, is not, ""Did Scott Card really mean the aliens to be a metaphor for people of other nations?"" Because the answer is probably no, Scott Card is an asshole, but it doesn't matter, because textual analysis of the book allows one to read exactly that metaphor out of it and to support that interpretation with textual evidence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are no critics taken seriously who derive nonsense from a work of art. Internet message boards may be full of them, but actual art criticism demands that an interpretation be supported by the work itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's a fantastic summary of the point in a piece of set dressing from the film Birdman.

George Soros said that himself.) news sources, Jezebel/Young Turks/woke internet culture, CNN ""news,"" and countless Youtube propaganda channels: Are blatantly anti-man. And one thing you might not know: Is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws FEDERAL to affect all males nationwide. So we need to be ready for that if it comes to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Controlled Mass Media: ^ Those sources I just mentioned, say the Soros funded propaganda sources like: BuzzFeed ""News"", Contrapoints, Young Turks type Youtube Channels & CNN ""News,"" are the biggest ""news"" sources in the country mostly. I put quotes around ""news"" because nowadays? There is no line between news and propaganda these days. This is INSANELY fascist, to a terrifying degree. And a ""professional news network"" like CNN, with the help of Cultural Marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that Cultural Marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (Obviously.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With White Supremacy: ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!!! Lol, but seriously... We are terrified beyond rationality, because of the far left propagandists telling you that white people are responsible for all things wrong in the world and throughout history. And people become SO brainwashed that you're fine with them being falsely accused and losing their jobs if it's ""going to keep you safe and not hurt any feelings!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also worth mentioning: They don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed ""torture."" and ""inhumane."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: ""Gender-Fluid"" You know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... But they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (We'll get into that in a bit.) Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why? Maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... Well... Let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history. [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Religion and Universities Intertwined: The changing of the meaning of words are a thing because ""equality."" By the way, rocks and pebbles are microaggressions. Oh, you disagree with me? Well ""academics"" at this super lefty university said they are. Can you prove that academics didn't tell me that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is how fascists talk. It's all part of a game they play. ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR THIS TACTIC. Make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. They never have any. Ever. They only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. And then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you ""lost the argument"" or ""got banned LOL."" Never give them the satisfaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hammer them down on data and facts. Don't let them pivot. Don't let them argue in ""moral territory,"" because that's entirely ""subjective."" Moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like ""immoral."" For instance: ""Immigration Policy."" the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is ""immoral."" Just keep it in ""OBJECTIVE territory."" Don't budge. Don't show emotion. Just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. Prove that all they do is argue from feelings. Not ""FACTS"" and ""LOGIC!"" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah: ""Women are oppressed in America more than other countries,"" and ""It's impossible for black people to be racist,"" ""gender is a spectrum!"" etc. You can literally pretend social science is telling you ANYTHING. ""Culture Wars"" have been the most gruesome in existence. They think ""social science"" told us that women are oppressed. You say ""no, they're not..."" Then they say:""Can you prove that?!"" And the ""social science"" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse. And they could repeat that for an hour, and people in this country won't even think that's irrational and moronic at this point. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​",saint2e,"I think this will be EXTREMELY valuable in swaying people. As we fit into EVERY one of these to varying degrees. (Some of them 100%) One of the biggest problems it that the average American DOESN'T. KNOW. WHAT. THE. FUCK. FASCISM. IS... And that's a MASSIVE problem. So I'd like to create a very clear, modern collection of examples people can use as a reference. I would really love it, if this lovely community contributed their own thoughts or examples!... (From me, a supposed ""Nazi,"" Which is a term that has no meaning annymore. Lol.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Powerful and Oppressive Tech companies: We have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship. The definition of ""safety"" has become a dog-whistle of sorts, as well as the definition of ""violence,"" the definition of the phrase ""hate crimes,"" etc. Have all come to mean ""things I don't like,"" and have utterly racist and violent implications today. Google's ""Do the right thing"" implies that their employees know America is NOT doing the right things right now. But to openly question that would make them feel like a white supremacist/misogynist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Different Opinions: This is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: ""But people will suffer if this happens!"" They don't care. I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about ""spectrums"" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that ""these degenerates and undesirables"" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary ""social justice"" or ""dismantling"" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (Lmao.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Supremacy of the Media: Uh, yeah. Lmao. We have the LARGEST, most expensive media in the history of the planet. We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's ""moral"" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you ""immoral"" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to ""Learn to Code"", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: ""THIS IS HARRASSMENT! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEM!"" Card. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Rampant Sexism: Yeah. Men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. Men are harassed more than I've ever seen these days. Men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. False Rape Accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. Anita Sarkeesian said ""Believe all Women,"" to men who told her they've been falsely accused. And she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: ""Help!  Abuse!  Harassment!"" when they disagreed.  And this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. It ended up in: Jezebel articles everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And Feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying.

It's terrifying to think that it's transparent now... THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY TO HIDE IT. That is a RED FLAG, you guys... I mean, Google is saying they're going to rig search engine results and YouTube trending charts to avoid another Trump term... And even dishonest reasons sometimes. They don't have to tell the truth, they can do terrible things that screw the working class, they can wage unjust wars, they can take money from shady sources, and what are we going to do? It's like they're taunting us with that: ""Yeah, I just screwed you over, and everybody knows it was me. And I already have billions, but I felt like having a little bit more. And everybody knows I have all your information already. And nobody cares. What are you going to do about it?"" Kinda like how Google got rid of the euphemisms, and straight up started admitting banning people they don't like: ""ALT RIGHT!"" Hmm... You know what that sounds like? Jewish people. Only instead of stars of David, they'd better have their Democrat memberships on them, they're going to start banning more and more conservatives now, or they're going to be calls to their employers to fire them from their jobs, and their kids are going to be starving on dirt floors getting assaulted by Cultural Marxists accusing them of misogyny and white supremacy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, Cultural Marxists is going to be able to shred evidence of their atrocities easier as Google is starting to use their Authoritarian powers to get rid of the people warning us to prevent them from doing this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Fraudulent Elections: This is the iffy one. This is LUCKILY the one that isn't 100% certain. I know that the polls, as Noam Chomsky once said: ""Are designed to control the voters."" And influence how we vote. I know Google is going influence the next election. And I'm from California, one of the most liberal states in the nation: And THOUSANDS of people who were registered as ""Republican,"" as you had to be to vote for Donald Trump, were changed to either ""Liberal,"" ""Libertarian,"" or ""Independent,"" due to a ""glitch in the system."" (Hmmmmm.....) But that isn't a regular occurrence so much. I mean, Trump winning against a 20 year-congresswoman and former first lady is astounding. That one is still up for debate. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] **So, what do you think? Anything you'd like to add?!**","-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because ""they're a private company they can do what they want"", and ""the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations"", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science ""white supremacy."" That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be ""fetishizing"". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's ""white supremacy."" Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as ""honorable,"" and/or ""necessary."" To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant ""We will not be silenced by your violence"" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free...

Few can define what it really means, since it's supposed to be something really really bad.

A way for the 'parasites' (bourgeoisie) to hang on there in a changing world. 'Parasites' is a horrible word to use about people, but if one looks at nature at a tree fungus for instance and think coldly like a scientist, it isn't a bad analogue.

[linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   [linebreak] You know that SJW cartoon of ""I'm not racist but ..."" where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says ""shush, nothing good ever comes after that""?    [linebreak] Whenever you catch yourself wanting to write ""white people"" or ""white males"", just shush yourself.  Never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.  You can call them stupid neanderthals but they out-manoevered your side and have stacked the federal courts and  Supreme Court for a few decades.  If Trump were impeached tomorrow they still would be winning.
